# MVDiffusion
We propose MVDiffusion, a simple yet effective multi-view image generation method for scenarios where pixel-to-pixel correspondences are available, such as perspective crops from panorama or multi-view images given geometry (depth maps and poses). 

# Paper
We are currently working on paper release, expected to be released today or tomorrow.

# Code
Code coming early August. We are now cleaning and debugging to ensure reproducibility.
